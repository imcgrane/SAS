/* Question 32.5 #2
Given the program here, add the necessary statements to compute four new variables:
a. Weight in kilograms (1 kg = 2.2 pounds). Name this variable WtKg.
b. Height in centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 cm). Name this variable HtCm.
c. Average blood pressure (call it AveBP) equal to the diastolic blood pressure plus
one-third the difference of the systolic blood pressure minus the diastolic blood
pressure.
d. A variable (call it HtPolynomial) equal to 2 times the height squared plus 1.5
times the height cubed.*/

input ID $
Height /* in inches */
Weight /* in pounds */
SBP /* systolic BP */
DBP /* diastolic BP */;


WtKg = Weight/2.2;
HtCm = Height * 2.54;
AveBP = DBP+(1/3 * (SBP-DBP));
HtPolynomial = (2*Height**2)+(1.5*Height**3);

 a. Write a SAS program to create a temporary SAS data set called Vote. Use the
 variable names State, Party, and Age. Age should be stored as a numeric variable;
 State and Party should be stored as character variables.
 b. Include a procedure to list the observations in this data set.
 c. Include a procedure to compute frequencies for Party.*/
